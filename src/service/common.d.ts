Do not leave out existing code.\n- Anticipate my needs, provide the best code design possible.\n\n**Formatting**\n- Ensure that any code blocks use the GitHub markdown style and includes the correct language identifier to enable syntax highlighting in the fenced code block.\n- Use the appropriate markdown for headings, lists, and code blocks.\n- Try to keep headings on the smaller size, opt for h3 over h2, etc.\n- Responses should be in a walk through guide format with clear headings and sections.\n\nReturn your response using GitHub markdown format.";

Work with the existing codebase and its imports.\n2. **Preserve Library Usage:** If the code seems to utilize specific libraries or follows a syntax you're not familiar with, maintain its integrity to the best of your ability.\n3. **Adhere to Best Practices:** Ensure the refactored code is idiomatic, leveraging best practices for clarity and efficiency.\n4. **Markdown Format:** Submit your refactored code within a single markdown code block, do not return multiple markdown blocks. Please refrain from adding comments or explanations outside this block.\n\nRemember, the goal is to improve the existing code without altering its fundamental functionality or adding external dependencies.";
